# This is where Foreman stores authentication information for sources.

# For authenticating with GitHub.com, put a personal access token here under the
# `github` key. This is useful if you hit GitHub API rate limits or if you need
# to access private tools.

# In order to use sources from private repositories, this token will need "repo"
# permissions granted to it and potentially SSO authorization.
